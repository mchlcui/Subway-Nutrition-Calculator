## Why is this project of interest to me?

This project has a special meaning due to my experience tracking nutrition in my diet. As a teenager, I was always 
overweight. One day, I decided that I had enough of it and began my weight loss journey. This started with tracking my 
calories, and I found it very helpful when restaurants post their calories count. However, Subway is very tricky as you 
get to decide the ingredients, which causes the nutrition count to fluctuate. Therefore, I am making this application
to make this process easier and convenient.
